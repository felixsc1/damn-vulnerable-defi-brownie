# Damn Vulnerable DeFi

This is a fork of [damn vulnerable defi](https://github.com/tinchoabbate/damn-vulnerable-defi/tree/v2.0.0), an ethereum wargame consisting of a series of challenges in which DeFi smart contracts need to be hacked.

Here, I implemented everything in brownie instead of the javascript used in the original repo. It also contains my solutions (beware of spoilers).

See <https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/> for the descriptions of the challenges.

## Notes

- Initial commit. Only the *unstoppable* challenge is implemented so far. More to follow...

- Make sure you have openzeppelin-contracts (4.4.2) imported via the brownie package manager.
